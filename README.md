> A simple but powerful command-line interface (CLI) for managing your to-do list right from the terminal.

Tasker is built with Go and Cobra to be fast, cross-platform, and easy to use. Never leave your terminal to manage your daily tasks again!

## Demo

Here is a quick demonstration of the core workflow:

Alternatively, here's a text-based preview:

```bash
# Add a few new tasks
$ tasker add "Write the project README file"
Added new task: "Write the project README file"
$ tasker add "Deploy the new feature"
Added new task: "Deploy the new feature"

# List all tasks
$ tasker list
ID    TASK                           STATUS
--    ----                           ------
1     Write the project README file  Pending
2     Deploy the new feature         Pending

# Mark a task as complete by its ID
$ tasker complete 1
Completed task: "Write the project README file"

# List tasks again to see the change
$ tasker list
ID    TASK                           STATUS
--    ----                           ------
1     Write the project README file  âœ“ Completed
2     Deploy the new feature         Pending

# Clean up by removing all completed tasks
$ tasker clean
Successfully cleaned 1 completed task.

# The list is now clean and re-indexed
$ tasker list
ID    TASK                           STATUS
--    ----                           ------
1     Deploy the new feature         Pending
```

## Features

- **Add:** Quickly add new tasks to your list.
- **List:** View all your tasks in a clean, formatted table.
- **Complete:** Mark tasks as complete using their ID.
- **Clean:** Remove all completed tasks to keep your list tidy.
- **Persistent:** Your tasks are saved to a `.tasks.json` file in your home directory, so they are always there when you come back.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Installation

### Option 1: Using `go install` (For Go developers)

If you have Go installed and configured on your system, you can install `tasker-cli` with a single command.

```bash
go install github.com/neaj-morshad-101/tasker-cli@latest
```
This will download the source, compile it, and place the `tasker-cli` binary in your Go `bin` directory (`$HOME/go/bin` by default), which should be in your system's `PATH`.

### Option 2: From Pre-compiled Binaries (Recommended)

For most users, the easiest way is to download a pre-compiled binary for your operating system.

1.  Go to the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/neaj-morshad-101/tasker-cli/releases) on GitHub.
2.  Download the appropriate archive for your system (e.g., `tasker-cli_linux_amd64.tar.gz` or `tasker-cli_windows_amd64.zip`).
3.  Extract the `tasker-cli` (or `tasker-cli.exe`) binary.
4.  Move the binary to a directory that is in your system's `PATH`. On Linux/macOS, `/usr/local/bin` is a great choice.
    ```bash
    # For Linux / macOS
    mv tasker-cli /usr/local/bin/
    ```
